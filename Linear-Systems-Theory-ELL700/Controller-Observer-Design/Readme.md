# Controller-Observer Design
In this work, state feedback controller and reduced order functional observer has been designed for LTI system

For more info, please refer this [report](https://github.com/deepakraina99/PhD-Course-Projects-IITD/blob/master/Linear-Systems-Theory-ELL700/Controller-Observer-Design/Report.pdf)

> This work has been done as part of Linear Systems Theory
> course at IIT Delhi.

#### System Specs:
- Windows/Ubuntu OS (32/64 bits)
- MATLAB R2019b with System Control Toolbox
# How to run the code?
#### Steps:
**1.** Specify the matrix A, B, C in *getCtrlObsDesign.m* file. The sytem can also be specified in *LTI_SYS.m*. 

**2.** Run the file *getCtrlObsDesign.m*

**3.** The other parameters like user-defined poles, controller tunning can be done through *inputs.m* file

**Note:** This code has been tested on 15 LTI systems given in *LTI_SYS.m* file
