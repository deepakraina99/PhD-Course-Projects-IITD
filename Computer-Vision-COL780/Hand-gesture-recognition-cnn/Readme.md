# Hand gesture-based control of Music Player using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
In this assignment, convolutional neural network of 5 layers is trained for recognizing 4 classes of hand-gestures direction. These classes are - Next, Previous, Stop, None.

# How to run the code?
#### Steps:

**1.** Without Media player integration
 
 *python test.py*
 
**2.** With media player integration (requires few media .mp3 files in the current directory)

*python vlctest.py*
